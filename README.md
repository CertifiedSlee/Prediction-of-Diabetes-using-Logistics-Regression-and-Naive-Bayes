# Prediction-of-Diabetes-using-Logistics-Regression-and-Naive-Bayes
This is a machine learning project that uses logistic regression and Naive Bayes algorithms to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 768 samples and 8 features, including age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, as well as a target variable indicating whether or not the patient developed diabetes within the following 5 years.

# Libraries Used:
The following Python libraries were used for this project:
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn

# Models Used:
Two classification models were used for this project:
    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes

# Results
The models were trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%. The results of the project showed that both logistic regression and Naive Bayes algorithms achieved good performance in predicting diabetes.

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 77.9% while the Naive Bayes model achieved an accuracy of 74.9%.
